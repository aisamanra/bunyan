**Bunyan** is a work-in-progress tool for guiding and facilitating
`CHANGELOG` generation from `git log` output. Lots of tools exist that
do this in an automatic way: however, Bunyan does not want to simply
generate a changelog _for_ you; instead, it's a tool for walking `git
log` output and asking you to categorize or ignore each commit, then
rearranging and formatting those commit messages in a way that is more
amenable to reading by an end-user.
